## Architecture Overview

This chat application is built using React (Vite) for the frontend and integrates Google Gemini API for AI-powered responses. It is designed to be lightweight, responsive, and user-friendly, with features like chat history management and a "New Conversation" reset option.

### Architecture Breakdown

#### 1️⃣ Frontend (React + Vite)

The frontend handles:
- ✅ User Interface (Chat messages, input fields, buttons, etc.)
- ✅ State Management (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- ✅ API Calls (Sending user input to the Gemini API)
- ✅ Local Storage Management (Saving and loading chat history)

**Key Components:**

| Component      | Purpose                                       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Home.jsx       | Main chat UI (handles user input, displays messages) |
| main.js        | Handles API integration with Google Gemini    |
| App.jsx        | Manages routing and app structure             |
| localStorage.js| Utility functions to save/load chat history   |

#### 2️⃣ Backend (Google Gemini API Integration)

There is no separate backend—the app directly communicates with Google Gemini API to generate AI responses.

**API Request Flow:**

1. User types a message and sends it.
2. The app calls `sendMessageToGemini()` (in main.js).
3. The function sends the message to Gemini API.
4. Gemini responds with text, which is displayed in the chat.

#### 3️⃣ Local Storage (Chat History Management)

The chat history is stored locally in `localStorage`, allowing users to persist conversations even after refreshing the page.

**Functions Used:**

| Function          | Purpose                            |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| `loadChatHistory()`| Loads previous messages from `localStorage` |
| `saveChatHistory()`| Saves new messages to `localStorage` |
| `clearChatHistory()`| Deletes all messages when starting a new conversation |
